We were [G]waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest [D]moon
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too [G]soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your [G7]smiling [C]face
And I long once more for [G]your em[E7]brace
In that [A7]beautiful Ken[D7]tucky [G]waltz
