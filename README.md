# lyr-sheets
This repository contains all source files for my music sheet collection that is compatible with [lyr](https://github.com/heinrob/lyrium), a command line tool for transposing and generating PDFs.

Currently under construction towards the very similar [Chordpro Format](https://chordpro.org/).

## delyrium
